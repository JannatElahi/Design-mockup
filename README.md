# Design-mockup
Udacity Project-- BUILD A PORTFOLIO SITE

A mockup design is given in the instructor notes. In this project, we have to replicate the given design.

First, the mockup design was to be downloaded and reviewed througouly. 

To review the mockup design, first count the number of boxes in the design. Then, form a layout by making
columns and rows.

Once the layout is well thought,the html and css files are to be written.

Html file is the structure of the page. With the help of tags, the structure of the webpage is made. 

The css file then does the styling of the webpage. In addition, bootstrap.css file needs to be downloaded and used.

In addition to this, similar images to the mockup had to be found on google and used. 

In the end, validate all html and css files against the W3C's Validators.
